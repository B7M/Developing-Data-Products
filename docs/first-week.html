<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> First week</h1>
<p>In this overview module, we’ll go over some information and resources to help you get started and succeed in the course.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Welcome to Developing Data Products</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Bryan Caffo and I am excited to welcome you to the Developing Data Products course. This course is designed to provide you with the necessary tools for improving the data analysis process and making data-driven decisions. Shaun Cross and I, both from the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, have co-developed the second version of this course. We have updated much of the old content and added new techniques for building in-demand data tools in R. Throughout this course, we will cover a range of topics including R Markdown, which allows you to create websites, PDFs, presentations, and even e-books from a single file in R. We will also teach you the latest features of the Shiny package, which you can use to create interactive web applications in R. In addition, we will cover interactive graphics using Plotly and Leaflet, which enables you to create beautiful maps that you can share online. You will also learn how to use GoogleViz to create maps, interactive graphics, and tables. We’ve also added a section on how to use swirl and swirlify to design courses in R so that you can share your knowledge. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you in class!</p>

<div id="a-note-of-explanation" class="section level3" number="1.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> A Note of Explanation</h3>
<p>This course is used in two different specializations. The Data Science Specialization is a 10-course sequence that covers the full length of the data science pipeline, whereas Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning covers only the second half of that sequence.</p>
<p>If you are taking Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning, please note that you will occasionally encounter references to the full 10-course Data Science Specialization. We apologize for any confusion that those references may cause.</p>
<p>If you find that you are not quite ready for the courses in Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning, you should consider first completing Data Science: Foundations using R in order to build the foundational skills that will help you be prepared for the next step of the journey.</p>

<div id="plagiarism" class="section level4" number="1.1.3.11">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3.11</span> Plagiarism</h4>
<p>Johns Hopkins University defines plagiarism as “…taking for one’s own use the words, ideas, concepts or data of another without proper attribution. Plagiarism includes both direct use or paraphrasing of the words, thoughts, or concepts of another without proper attribution.” We take plagiarism very seriously, as does Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>We recognize that many students may not have a clear understanding of what plagiarism is or why it is wrong. Please see the JHU referencing guide for more information on plagiarism.</p>
<p>It is critically important that you give people/sources credit when you use their words or ideas. If you do not give proper credit – particularly when quoting directly from a source – you violate the trust of your fellow students.</p>
<p>The Coursera Honor code includes an explicit statement about plagiarism:</p>
<p>I will register for only one account. My answers to homework, quizzes and exams will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration). I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes or exams available to anyone else. This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any official solutions provided by the course staff. I will not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve/hurt the results of others.</p>

<div id="reporting-plagiarism-on-course-projects" class="section level4" number="1.1.3.12">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3.12</span> Reporting plagiarism on course projects</h4>
<p>One of the criteria in the project rubric focuses on plagiarism. Keep in mind that some components of the projects will be very similar across terms and so answers that appear similar may be honest coincidences. However, we would appreciate if you do a basic check for obvious plagiarism and report it during your peer assessment phase.</p>
<p>It is currently very difficult to prove or disprove a charge of plagiarism in the MOOC peer assessment setting. We are not in a position to evaluate whether or not a submission actually constitutes plagiarism, and we will not be able to entertain appeals or to alter any grades that have been assigned through the peer evaluation system.</p>
<p>But if you take the time to report suspected plagiarism, this will help us to understand the extent of the problem and work with Coursera to address critical issues with the current system.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Welcome</h3>
<p>Welcome - <a href="https://datasciencespecialization.github.io/Developing_Data_Products/welcome.html">Read on GitHub</a></p>
<p>I’m glad that you decided to take Developing Data Products, part of the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins Biostatistics!</p>
<p>A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. This course focuses on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.</p>
<p>You will learn how to communicate using statistics and statistical products. Emphasis will be paid to communicating uncertainty in statistical results. You will learn how to create simple Shiny web applications and R packages for their data products. In addition, we’ll cover reproducible presentations and interactive graphics.</p>
<p>We believe that the key word in Data Science is “science”. Our specialization is focused on providing you with three things: (1) an introduction to the key ideas behind working with data in a scientific way that will produce new and reproducible insight, (2) an introduction to the tools that will allow you to execute on a data analytic strategy, from raw data in a database to a completed report with interactive graphics, and (3) on giving you plenty of hands on practice so you can learn the techniques for yourself. This course represents the final cog in a data science application, creating an end-usable data product.</p>
<p>We are excited about the opportunity to attempt to scale Data Science education. We intend for the courses to be self-contained, fast-paced, and interactive.</p>
<p>Some Basics</p>
<p>A couple of first week housekeeping items. First, make sure that you’ve had R Programming and the Data Scientist’s Toolbox. Reproducible Research would be helpful, but is not mandatory. At a minimum you must know: very basic git, basic R and very basic knitr.</p>
<p>An important aspect of this class is to peruse the materials in the github repository. All of the most up to date material can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/Developing_Data_Products" class="uri">https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/Developing_Data_Products</a></p>
<p>You should clone this repository as your first step in this class and make sure to fetch updates periodically. (Please send pull requests too!) It is one of the most essential components of the Specialization that you start to use Git frequently. We’re practicing what we preach as well by using the tools in the series to create the series, especially git.</p>
<p>You can clone the whole repo with (http)</p>
<p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/Developing_Data_Products.git" class="uri">https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/Developing_Data_Products.git</a>
or (ssh)
git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com" class="email">git@github.com</a>:DataScienceSpecialization/Developing_Data_Products.git
The lectures are in the index.Rmd lecture files. In this class, we’ll cover how to create these sorts of slides. You will see all of the R code to recreate the lectures. Going through the R code is the best way to familiarize yourself with the lecture materials.</p>
<p>The lecture material for this class is largely front-loaded. This is because the latter time of the class is devoted to developing your data application. Thus the class should be doable in about a 1 month’s time or maybe less. Though make sure you’re keeping up with the classes at the beginning so that you have some space in your schedule later on for app development!</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Shiny - <a href="https://datasciencespecialization.github.io/Developing_Data_Products/shiny.html">Read on GitHub</a></h3>
<p><strong>Remember to read the book chapters on Shiny.</strong></p>
<p>Shiny is an important enough topic to devote a lot of time to it. Shiny is another product by RStudio and it is described by RStudio as “A web application framework for R”. They further add “Turn your analyses into interactive web applications No HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge required”. This is mostly true, though a little HTML at least would be useful for understanding some of the concepts. Here’s a useful site for learning html basics. We’ll proceed as if your html knowledge is very basic and no more advanced than understanding heading levels for fonts. It is important to dinstiguish between a Shiny applications (app) and a Shiny server. A Shiny server is required to host a shiny app for the world. Otherwise, only those who have have shiny installed and have access to your code could run your web page (really defeating the purpose of making a web page in the first place).</p>
<p>In this class, we won’t cover creating a shiny server, as that requires understanding a little linux server administration. Instead, we’ll run our apps locally and use RStudio’s service for hosting shiny apps (their servers) on a platform called shinyapps.io. In other words, RStudio does the server work for your so that all you need to worry about is building your app. Shinyapps.io is free up to a point in that you can only run 5 apps for a certain amount of time per month. This will be fine for our purposes, but if you’re really going to get into making Shiny apps, you’ll have to spring for a paid plan or run your own server.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Shinyapps.io Project - <a href="https://datasciencespecialization.github.io/Developing_Data_Products/shinyproject.html">Read on GitHub</a></strong></p>
<p>Some people in this session let us know that they are concerned about running up against the 25-hour per month limit on the free tier of shinyapps.io.</p>
<p>Should you hit the limit on the free plan, RStudio will send you a message. If you receive the message and are more than a few days from getting a fresh 25 hours on your monthly renewal, please send an email to <a href="mailto:shinyapps-support@rstudio.com" class="email">shinyapps-support@rstudio.com</a> with the email address you use on the service and the account name you are using (the first part of the URL). RStudio will then increase your limit so you can continue working on your project.</p>
<p>Since there are a lot of folks in the class we’d appreciate if you only emailed RStudio after you get the message and only if you feel you’ll need more time.</p>
</div>
<div id="shiny-1.1" class="section level3" number="1.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Shiny 1.1</h3>
<p>Here we will introduce Shiny, which is the cornerstone of this course and we will be using it to develop data products. Shiny is a web development framework in R. Shiny is a web development framework that is based on R, so you only need to know R to use it. With Shiny, you can use R for both the back end and front end of the development process. This means you don’t need to be familiar with standard tools like JavaScript, HTML, and so on. However, we will briefly talk about these later in the course. So, let’s talk about Shiny and its use in data science. Shiny has been a game-changer for data scientists who specialize in R and focus on developing algorithms and analysis. However, if you come from a web development background, you probably have a different set of tools at your disposal, and Shiny may not be your first choice. Shiny is a great tool for those who want to prototype potential data products, especially if you are a smaller organization. For larger organizations, Shiny can be used to create a prototype, which can then be converted by other skilled professionals into a more polished and visually appealing product using compiled languages, JavaScript, and HTML.</p>
<p>With Shiny we create the GUI in R, the algorithms and everything else that are powering it in terms of the data science part is all written in R. That means your time to create a data product is completely minimized. As we mentioned Shiny is made by R Studio, it’s free; however, hosting Shiny on a server, could potentially cost you money because you need to actually have a web server that is not only going to serve up the web pages but is also going to call R in the back end to run your algorithms or models. Surprisingly, RStudio has a free hosting service, and that’s what we’re going to use for the class. If you choose to host the application on your own server, you could run off of AWS or something like that, Amazon AWS. If you only need portability at a local level, you can create and test Shiny apps locally and share them with others who use RStudio. However, the real benefit of Shiny is the ability to create a web server that anyone can access to display your data analysis or prediction algorithm. In this class, we will use shinyapps.io as our free server, and we will cover how to use it later on. Today, we will start from scratch and build a working web server with R as the back end.</p>
<p>Before we dive into using Shiny, there are a few prerequisites to keep in mind. Although everything is done in R, some basic knowledge of HTML is recommended. While it’s not necessary to know CSS or JavaScript, familiarity with some HTML commands can help you better understand what the R commands are doing. However, we won’t be teaching HTML here as there are plenty of online tutorials available to learn from.</p>
<p>Shiny incorporates the Bootstrap package, which is not related to the statistics bootstrap, but is instead a web design framework developed by Twitter. Bootstrap provides a set of buttons and other design elements that look good and resize well on various devices, from small phones to large screens. The creators of Bootstrap have put a lot of thought into making it user-friendly. If you are not familiar with web development, it’s recommended to stick with the Bootstrap themes in Shiny.</p>
<p>To learn about the three core components of the applications we’ll be developing, you can refer to some tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Briefly, CSS provides styling, JavaScript is responsible for interactivity, and HTML is the backbone of the front end. It’s crucial to familiarize yourself with HTML, so be sure to check out some HTML tutorials. To get started with Shiny, you’ll need to install it using the command “install.packages(‘shiny’)” and then ensure it’s loaded by typing “library(shiny)”. Before beginning, it’s worth considering the official Shiny tutorial at RStudio, which this lecture will largely be following.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s quickly go over the basics of a Shiny project before we jump into some code demonstrations. To create a Shiny project, you need two files: ui.R and server.R. The ui.R file is responsible for creating the user interface and determining how your app will look, while the server.R file controls the app’s behavior and functionality. It’s time to transition into some code demonstrations, so please stay tuned.</p>
</div>
<div id="shiny-1.2" class="section level3" number="1.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Shiny 1.2</h3>
<p>To create our first app, you’ll need a relatively recent version of RStudio. The easiest way to start is by clicking Alt+F (on Windows) or File (on Mac), then selecting New File, and then Shiny Web App. Name your app whatever you want, such as “myApp.” Next, you can choose whether to have the files in a single file or in two separate files, a ui.R and a server.R file, which we will talk about. We recommend doing it with two files.
It’s preferred to work with many small files rather than one big file containing multiple functions. However, it’s important to note that the specific named functions within the ui.R and server.R files are what’s required, not just the files themselves. Now go ahead and create a directory and the two files, namely ui.R and server.R, by copying the versions from lecture notes into the pre-populated Shiny files. The ShinyUI function controls the user interface, and the shinyServer function is required in the server.R file. Although our server doesn’t do anything in this case.
Let’s take a closer look at the ShinyUI function. The fluidPage function specifies the type of page used to create the user interface, which is typically the default option. The titlePanel function sets the title of the GUI element to “Data science FTW!” The fluidPage function contains a main panel and a side panel by default, so we use the sidebarLayout function to specify the sidebar’s contents. The sidebarPanel function is used to specify the sidebar’s contents, and the h3 function sets the third-level heading for the “slidebar Text” and “Main panel text”.
You can run the Shiny app in two ways. Firstly, if you have a recent version of RStudio, you can click “Run App” to run the app. Secondly, you can switch to the directory where the ui.R and server.R files are located and run the runApp() function. You can also specify the app’s path within the function. RStudio creates a local web server, which can be accessed using RStudio’s browser. Finally, to share the app with others, you can give them the required functions and files. However, ultimately, we want to deploy the app on a public web server so that it can be accessed by anyone, not just RStudio users.
While it’s possible to simply share the code with others so they can run it, that’s not our ultimate goal. Our goal is to have the app running on a webpage. We’ve taken the first step, so now let’s continue and work on adding functionality to make the app more useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="shiny-1.3" class="section level3" number="1.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Shiny 1.3</h3>
<p>When we’re constructing our Shiny app using the default workflow, it’s important to remember that we’ll be utilizing R to insert our HTML elements. Fortunately, Shiny incorporates all of the typical HTML tags, such as the various heading tags (h1 through h6), hyperlinks, divs, spans, and other commonly used ones. To view a comprehensive list of all the HTML tags available, simply type in <strong>”?builder”</strong>. In the future, we’ll demonstrate how you can use your own HTML file to build your Shiny app, giving you the freedom to create a more intricate page. However, for now, we’ll be using the pre-built functions. The following code example will display the various heading styles and other elements.</p>
<p><strong>insert the code</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go over the various HTML tags that we can utilize in our Shiny app, or at least a subset of them. Specifically, we will be covering the formatting tags. In the UI.R function, we have added some headings including h1, h2, h3, which are all located in the sidebar layout. Additionally, we have included some emphasized text and code text, which is displayed in a mono space format. It’s always best to display code in this format, just like when editing code. Once you run the app, you can see the different heading values, main panel, and code displayed in mono space format. To view all of the available HTML tags, simply type in ?builder. This will provide a comprehensive list of all the tags that can be used.
Let’s run the app again so that it’s up and running. If you click on “Open in Browser,” it will open the app in a web browser. Here, you can view the HTML tags used by the app. Alternatively, you can use Ctrl+U to view the R code that generates the webpage. This will allow you to see how the app uses JavaScript libraries to run Shiny. You may not need to worry about the head section unless you have some familiarity with JavaScript.</p>
<p>Most of the elements you see here are style sheets from Twitter Bootstrap, which provides the formatting for all the buttons and styles that Shiny uses. However, this section also contains some of the input and output components that Shiny requires. The majority of the content we display is in the body, where you can observe how the function creates the HTML commands by translating your UI.R. This is a valuable exercise, particularly when creating named buttons and other similar components. It can also help you become more comfortable with coding in HTML if you’re familiar with Shiny but not with HTML. Eventually, if you intend to develop advanced web pages that call R in the back end, you’ll likely need to create your own pages rather than relying solely on UI.R. Therefore, playing around with HTML tags and designing a simple non-interactive webpage can help you become more familiar with them. In our next session, we’ll start adding buttons, sliders, and graphs, calling R in the back end, and exploring some of Shiny’s essential features.</p>
</div>
<div id="shiny-1.4" class="section level3" number="1.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.6</span> Shiny 1.4</h3>
<p>Our Shiny app needs to take input values, perform R calculations, and display the resulting output. To start, we must create a slider in the user interface for input values. The slider’s selected values will be passed to the server function and then returned to the user interface function for display. This is a preliminary exercise where we’re not using the input values for any calculations. Let’s proceed to create a slider in the sidebar panel of the shinyUI function. The slider’s name is “slider2” and it goes from 0 to 100, with a starting value of 0, and a prompt for the user to “Slide Me!”. The main panel will be discussed later. The slider’s selected value is given the name “slider2” and displayed to the user. The shiny server function takes input and output as arguments within curly braces to define the function.</p>
<p>In Shiny, a function needs to have curly braces and it needs to be closed with both curly braces and the shiny server parenthesis. The function takes input from the UI, which is the shiny UI function. We can remove the input for consistency with the code from the slides. The function takes in slider 2 and renders it, displaying the text. We can name the output text1. In the UI.R, in the main Panel, we specify that the slider value is displayed and the text output is text1. This ensures that the same text we labeled from the output in the server function will be displayed in the name panels. When we run the code, we can move the slider and see the slider value displayed.
Here the slider is receiving a value from the user and that value is given the label slider2. The server.R function grabs that value from the slot input $slider2. It then spits it back out as Output $text1, and the ui.R displays it. It’s important to note that there’s nothing special about having the slider in the side bar panel and the text in the main panel. The order isn’t significant either. The code for the slider and the output could be in different panels and still work fine. This is an important concept to keep in mind when working with Shiny and reactive expressions. You don’t want to think about it running linearly like a regular R program because the server is running reactively and constantly going back and forth. Your mindset needs to change a bit from regular R programming. It’s still a program, but it’s more interactive.
One thing to note is that if we were to label the text output $text instead of text1, it wouldn’t display anything. This is because the UI is looking for text1 when it says textOutput. Similarly, if we were to label the slider slider1 instead of slider2, it wouldn’t display anything because the render text from the server function is looking for slider2, but the UI hasn’t put out anything labeled slider2.

<p>We’ve reached a point where we can start utilizing Shiny in a manner that could be beneficial to us. One of the key ways in which Shiny proves helpful is in creating interactive graphics. R, in its default form, doesn’t possess a lot of capacity for interactive graphics. With Shiny, however, the scope is broadened, and it provides an efficient way to distribute your results as they’re embedded in a web page that you can share broadly. Now, we’re going to develop an interactive plot that requires a bit more code in the server.R functions. Once you go through this example, you should be able to utilize Shiny in a more practical way that can assist you with your everyday data science needs. Now, let’s proceed to the main task at hand.
So, we’ve copied the code from the R markdown document and let’s run it to check out the app before we delve into its internal workings. Essentially, it generates two sets of random uniforms and plots them. You can input the number of uniforms in the text box that also has an increment and decrement operator in the buttons on the right-hand side. The sliders enable you to alter the range of the uniforms generated on both the X and Y axes. There are also buttons available that enable you to Show/Hide the X Axis Label, Show/Hide the Y Axis Label, and Show/Hide the Title. So, we have two sliders, three checkboxes, and a numeric input, as shown. Observe how the code is executed interactively. Whenever there is a change in the values, the entire code is re-run. It’s important to get accustomed to the server calculations and reactive programming with Shiny, which, in my opinion, functions somewhat differently than standard R programming, which follows a highly linear pattern.
Let’s dive into the code and see how everything was achieved. To begin with, let’s start by analyzing the UI.r function, which is the Shiny UI function. Firstly, we have the title pane, which is self-explanatory. Then we have the numeric input, which is labeled as “numeric”. It includes a title, starting value, minimum, and maximum values, so that users cannot input values beyond the specified range. Additionally, there is a step sizer that controls the increment and decrement of values when the buttons on the right-hand side are pressed. Moving on to the two sliders, they are similar to ones we have seen before. The first slider, sliderX, has two values, which are used to determine the two points of the slider. The same applies to the Y slider. Lastly, we have three check boxes: show_xlab, show_ylab, and show_title. As for the sliders, the first slider is labeled as “sliderX” and the second one as “sliderY”. The labels for the check boxes are straightforward and need no explanation.
Let’s examine the code to see how we achieve our desired outcome in the UI and server functions. Starting with the UI.r function, we first have the title pane and a numeric input labeled as “numeric” with its corresponding title, starting value, minimum and maximum values, and step size. Next, we have two sliders, labeled as “sliderX” and “sliderY,” each with two values to establish their position. We also have a Y slider, which is essentially the same. Finally, there are three check boxes with labels that are pretty self-explanatory, namely, “show_xlab,” “show_ylab,” and “show_title.”
Moving on to the server function, we will generate the plot output. In the function, we define “output<span class="math inline">\(plot1&quot; so that when we display it on the user interface, it will show as plot1. Since it is a plot, we use the &quot;renderPlot&quot; statement, which uses reactive expressions (i.e., calculations that interact with the server). Reactive statements are enclosed in curly braces next to the renderPlot statement. After setting the random number seed, we assign the number of points to the input\)</span>numeric for convenience and to make the code more readable. The minimum and maximum values for X and Y are derived from the sliders, which are returned as a list, with the X slider’s values in a vector and the Y slider’s values in another vector. We then assign these values to variables for ease of reuse. Our data is a list of random uniform numbers generated using the”runif” function with the number of points and range between the minimum and maximum X values as arguments. Similarly, we generate the dataY vector using the number of points, minimum and maximum Y values.
We use an ifelse statement to define the labels for the X axis, Y axis, and title. The check box input$show_xlab determines whether or not the X axis is labeled, and its corresponding label is either “X Axis” or nothing. The same goes for the Y axis and title.
Finally, we create our plot, using the X and Y data generated earlier. The xlab, ylab, and title are all dependent on the values of their corresponding labels, and the x and y limits are set to predetermined values. We then return the plot. Running the code now that we understand its workings will allow us to view the output.
Let’s review what’s happening when we change a value. The Shiny server takes the input value for the server, which includes slider X value one, slider X value two, slider Y value one, slider Y value two, and show X lab and show Y lab, which can be true or false. As we input these values, the Shiny server continuously checks for new values, and every time it receives a new set of values, it re-runs and re-displays everything, communicating back and forth between the server and the UI. If your calculations are more complex, we can add a done button to prevent immediate re-running. This example is simple and fast, but later on, we’ll show you how to add a done button for more complex simulations. You can create your own interactive graphic by following this example and using different kinds of inputs, not just sliders and numeric inputs. This is a useful tool that can be extended to many meaningful applications. Your homework is to create an interactive graphic using Shiny and experiment with different inputs.</p>

<p>Welcome to the second lecture on Shiny. Today, we’ll delve into the fascinating world of reactive expressions. We’ll explore how they can be used to build more complex Shiny applications that perform sophisticated calculations, generate informative visualizations, and deliver insightful results. In the previous lecture, we learned the basics of creating interactive graphics using Shiny. However, to create more meaningful applications, we need to dive deeper and leverage the full power of Shiny. And that’s where reactivity comes in.
A reactive expression is like a recipe that takes input from Shiny and returns a computed value. It is an essential concept in Shiny that enables us to build applications that respond dynamically to user input. Using reactive expressions may require some unconventional R coding techniques, but it’s worth it for the additional functionality it provides.
To use reactive expressions, we need to wrap the expression in a reactive function. This function allows us to isolate expressions that respond to user input from the Shiny UI function. Let’s consider an example where we have two input boxes, one labeled “Box One” and the other “Box Two.” In our Shiny server function, suppose we want to add the values from Box One and Box Two and assign the result to a variable.</p>
<p>Our aim here is to develop a Shiny app that incorporates reactive expressions to enhance the complexity and meaningfulness of our server calculations, and consequently, generate more interesting graphs and results. So what exactly is a reactive expression? Essentially, it’s like a recipe that takes inputs from Shiny, manipulates them, and returns a value. However, due to the specific intricacies of Shiny, this requires some slightly unorthodox R coding. In particular, if you want isolated expressions that respond to input from your ui.r and Shiny.i function, they need to be wrapped as a reactive function. For instance, consider the scenario where we have two input boxes, labeled box one and box two, and we want to add the results from these boxes and assign the sum to a variable. To ensure that this calculation is redone every time the input values change, we need to include it in a reactive statement. The output of this calculation, calc_sum, is assigned as reactive, using a slightly unique notation that involves functional parentheses as well as curly braces containing the reactive statements. Once we add input<span class="math inline">\(box1 + input\)</span>box2 inside the reactive statement, the calc_sum() function will adapt as we input new values into box1 and box2.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move on to a relatively simple example that demonstrates how to create a reactive environment in Shiny. This example will provide you with a comprehensive tool set to start creating your own Shiny applications that can handle just about anything you need to do. For instance, if you have a machine learning algorithm, you can create an app that allows users to input parameters, generates predictions, and calculates prediction error on the fly.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the lecture, we’ll show you how to make the app reactive in such a way that the user has to press a button to execute the command. This conditionally reactive approach is useful for algorithms that take a lot of time to execute.</p>
<p>So, we’ll go through a code demonstration that heavily utilizes reactive expressions, and by the end of it, you’ll have a better understanding of how to incorporate these expressions into your own Shiny apps.</p>

<div id="shiny-2.2" class="section level3" number="1.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Shiny 2.2</h3>
<p>You can copy the code from the R Markdown document for the next set of examples. In the following, we will first demonstrate the user interface and then the server calculations. Our objective is to showcase reactive expressions. We start with the <code>shiny</code> library statement, followed by the <code>shinyUI</code> function, which uses <code>fluidPage</code>. This page will have a title and a <code>sidebarLayout</code> containing a <code>sidebarPanel</code> and a <code>mainPanel</code>. The <code>sidebarPanel</code> will include a <code>sliderInput</code> labeled as <code>sliderMPG</code> to input the car’s miles per gallon, and a checkbox to indicate whether certain model values should be displayed in the <code>mainPanel</code>. The default value for the <code>sliderInput</code> is 20, with a range of 10 to 35 miles per gallon. Our goal is to create an output that displays the prediction for the horsepower. In the <code>mainPanel</code>, the inputs are <code>showModel1</code> and <code>showModel2</code>.</p>
<p>The main panel will display the plot labeled plot1, which is defined in our server function to be displayed in the main panel. We will also have two text outputs labeled pred1 and pred2 that will be displayed in the main panel. In the user interface, we have a slider input labeled sliderMPG, which allows users to input the MPG of their car, and a checkbox labeled showModel1 and showModel2 to determine which model values to display in the output. The slider input has a default value of 20 and a range from 10 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon.</p>
<p>The label of the slider input to obtain the MPG is sliderMPG. Additionally, there are two checkboxes to determine whether to display the specific model output. These inputs will be sent to the server. In return, we expect the server functions to provide us with a plot labeled plot1, text labeled pred1, and text labeled pred2. Moving on to the server, the shinyServer function includes a function with input and output parameters.</p>
<p>The first step in the process is to load the default “mtcars” dataset. This dataset is commonly used in R as an example dataset and is used to create a spline term. If the mpg of the car is greater than 20, the spline term returns the mpg value. Otherwise, it returns 0. This is useful when feeding a model that has a “broken stick” feed - a line with a breakpoint at 20, followed by another line that meets continuously at the breakpoint. The code fits two models, one with just mpg and another with mpg at the breakpoint in the middle. These two models are used to form the prediction.
Next, we need to calculate predictions based on input values from the user interface, so it needs to be in a reactive statement. The reactive statement uses a parenthesis and a curly brace notation. We relabel the input as a regular R variable, mpgInput, to avoid typing “input<span class="math inline">\(&quot; repeatedly. We use the predict statement with model1 to predict the new value from the slider. Similarly, we create model2 with an extra spline term, mpgsp, that returns the input value if it is greater than 20, otherwise returning 0. The two reactive assigned variables are model1 pred and model2 pred. The first output that we create is output\)</span>plot1, which our user interface expects to be a plot labeled plot1. We use the renderPlot notation for a plot, using the mpgInput value obtained from the slider.</p>
<p>Next, a plot will be created. You should be familiar with R plotting, so you can review how it’s working. However, pay attention to the conditional values for whether or not the lines for model1 and model2 will be included, which are controlled by showModel1 and showModel2. The plot also has a nice legend. The most crucial part to note is that we will add some points at the miles per gallon value that you input, as shown in this code. Remember, we renamed it from input$sliderMPG earlier. Additionally, we want to include the result of our reactive expression, model1pred. However, remember that you need to access that number as a function because it was from a reactive expression elsewhere in the code.</p>
<p>If the parentheses are not included, the function will be returned, which cannot be plotted by points because it is a function. Therefore, to obtain the value, the parentheses must be included. The second point is that the output of this function is a plot that will be returned to the user interface. It will include the two fitted lines if the check boxes are checked, the data used to fit the lines, and specific points at the prediction values. Additionally, the code is looking for pred1 and pred2, which will be text. These will be rendered using the function renderText({) with the reactive expressions model1pred() and model2pred(), respectively. In both cases, the parentheses must be included for the reactive expression. Finally, the code can be run to see how it works.</p>
<p>And there it is, the plot is now generated. As we adjust the slider, you will notice the two prediction points appearing. The red line represents the model without the spline term, while the blue line has the spline term at 20, creating a broken stick-like pattern. We have successfully created our two models and added their respective predictions below the plot. Additionally, we can toggle the visibility of either of the two lines using the checkboxes. Once you have gone through this example, you should feel confident in working with Shiny and utilizing it for more complex tasks. In the next step, we will cover conditional expressions that allow us to operate on the code conditionally based on certain triggers, such as clicking a “done” button. But for now, you should be able to make good use of Shiny for your needs.</p>
<p>We encourage you to give this example a try, and I’m confident that after the next lecture, you’ll have a strong understanding of working with shiny apps and be able to create useful applications for yourself and others to use on the internet.</p>

<p>If the server functions in your Shiny app involve small, quick calculations, then it’s not a problem. However, if your app requires computationally intensive tasks like a large Monte Carlo simulation or Bootstrap, you might want to have the values settled before clicking a submit button. To do this, it only requires one extra line of code. Here, we have the same code as the previous example, set up in the same way. When we click Run App, the app appears, and as we move the slider, it runs the code again. Now, we want to add a submit button, so we’ll add this command from the slides: submitButton. The button’s value is Submit, and it provides a labeled input value called Submit that you can use in your server functions, for example, if the submitButton is true.</p>
<p>Forgetting to include commas after functional arguments is a common mistake in Shiny app development. It’s important to remember that these commas are necessary for the app to run properly. RStudio will usually indicate an error with a little “x” symbol. In the current example, we have added a submit button using the <code>submitButton</code> command, which takes a labeled input value called “Submit”. This button allows us to avoid rerunning the code every time we change the slider value. Instead, we can click the submit button to run the code after we have settled on a value. This can be useful for computationally intensive tasks like Monte Carlo simulations or Bootstrap. Remember that the submit button can be used as a label button in your server functions, so you can use it to control calculations or other aspects of your app. Adding a submit button is a quick and handy way to improve the functionality of your Shiny tools.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.4</span> Shiny 2.4</h3>
<p>Let’s review a few ways to customize the Shiny user interface. By default, you have a sidebar panel theme, but we’ll explore an alternative option using tabs. Once you understand these two examples, you’ll be able to adjust the interface using various settings. Additionally, we’ll briefly touch on using a custom HTML function for Shiny. Let’s start with the advanced UI example and wrap up with some final thoughts.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s go over a few ways we can modify the UI for Shiny. The code I’ll be working with was copied from an R Markdown document. You might already be familiar with the first few lines of code, as we’ll still be using a sidebar layout. However, we can also create tabs within a single panel, or have a panel with tabs but no sidebar. And if you’re feeling adventurous, we can even customize the UI with custom HTML.
For our sidebar panel, we’ll have three text input boxes labeled “Box 1”, “Box 2”, and “Box 3”. The prompts for the user will be “Enter Tab 1 text”, “Enter Tab 2 text”, and “Enter Tab 3 text”, respectively, with starting values of “Tab 1”, “Tab 2”, and “Tab 3”.
Moving on to the main panel, we’ll be using a tabset panel, which is a nested user interface structure in Shiny. We’ll use the <code>mainPanel</code> function with a <code>tabsetPanel</code> inside, specifying <code>type = "tabs"</code>. Within that, we’ll have three <code>tabPanel</code> functions, each with a label indicating “Tab 1”, “Tab 2”, or “Tab 3”, and a <code>textOutput</code> that will look for the corresponding output label from the <code>server.R</code> file.
The <code>server.R</code> function will be a simple one, using <code>shinyServer</code> with <code>function(input, output)</code> arguments. We’ll use <code>renderText</code> to display the text entered in each of the three input boxes.
Let’s run the app now!</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at our three text boxes for entering text and the three tabs. If we enter new text and go to Tab 2, it will display the new text. This is a good example of how we can customize the UI, and as you work with it more, you’ll become more familiar with the syntax. Be sure to avoid errors in your R code while making UI changes, as RStudio will show you X’s in the code if you forget to close parentheses or add commas. Proper indentation and using a nice environment like RStudio will make this task easier. Your homework is to create a tabbed user interface for Shiny. Finally, we’ll go over some last comments about Shiny.</p>

<div id="shiny-2.5" class="section level3" number="1.3.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.5</span> Shiny 2.5</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly promised to show you how to use your own HTML, and we have a quick way to do that. We took our last example, saved the HTML that it was running, and put it in a file called index.html in a subdirectory named www. Along with the server.R function, this is where the index.html file is located. The index.html file contains a lot of unnecessary preamble from the bootstrap style it gets from that package. So, you can remove most of that and have the style be whatever you want. If you’re not familiar with web development, you can start with a simple shiny page, output the HTML, and use that as a starting point to build from. But if you’re comfortable with web development, you can start with a blank HTML file and work from there.</p>
<p>The inputs function the same way as regular HTML inputs. In this example, we have three boxes labeled Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3. So, the input ID for Box 1 is “box1”, for Box 2 it’s “box2”, and for Box 3 it’s “box3”. The div statements are used because the Bootstrap style used by Shiny uses these blocky structures to create the default style.</p>
<p>Alright, so the input fields work just like regular HTML input. For instance, the input field with ID “box1” corresponds to the label we provided in the ui.R file. Similarly, we have input fields with IDs “box2” and “box3”. These div statements are necessary because Bootstrap, which is used by Shiny, uses this particular CSS style to create blocky structures for the default style.</p>
<p>Moving on to the output, you can see that it references “out2” and has the class “shiny-text-output”. If you’re familiar with web development, you may have recognized the output class “shiny-text-output” already. Otherwise, building a Shiny prototype app and grabbing its HTML would give you enough information to work with.</p>
<p>If you build a prototype and save the HTML, you can use it directly in your Shiny app by placing it in a file named index.html in a subdirectory named www. This method will be very useful for those who are experienced with web development and find using R as an intermediary to be a hassle. By using a straight HTML file, you can avoid having to insert individual HTML elements in R.</p>

<div id="shiny-2.6" class="section level3" number="1.3.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.6</span> Shiny 2.6</h3>
<p>In this example, we’ll demonstrate how to create an interactive graphic using the brush argument in the UI and brushedPoints argument in the server. The purpose is to highlight points in a scatter plot and show the fitted line just for those points. Interactive graphics are a key functionality of Shiny and one of its primary uses for analysis.
Let’s take a look at the code. We’ll go through the various lines, but we encourage you to try it out yourself by copying and running the code. You’ll likely gain a better understanding by doing so.
We start with the standard layout, including a sidebar. The sidebar displays the slope and intercept using textOutput (intOut) and textOutput (slopeOut), respectively. We need to make sure to include both labels in the server function, otherwise they won’t display correctly. Additionally, we create a plot in the server labeled plot1 and make sure to include plotOutput for it in the UI.
The UI also includes an id of brush1 and the brushOpts for the brush options. We’ll need to use the label brush1 on the server side. Next, let’s examine the server function. The input and output lists are passed into the Shiny server. A reactive model is created that responds to changes in the data input from the user interface. The notation for reactive functions is inside curly braces and parentheses. The variable brushed_data is shorthand for retrieving the data from brush1 in the input. The brush points come from the trees dataset with Girth as the x-variable and Volume as the y-variable. If there are fewer than two points, it returns null, otherwise, it fits a linear model with Volume as the y-variable, Girth as the x-variable, and brushed_data as the data. The resulting linear model is output without parentheses because it’s inside the reactive statement. In the Shiny server, we check if the model is fit or if the label output<span class="math inline">\(slopeOut is present. We use the renderText function to let Shiny know that text will be displayed in the user interface. Inside the curly braces, we check if the slope is null, and if so, it will display &quot;No Model Found&quot;. Otherwise, it will display the slope term. Alright, so let&#39;s dive into the code. The Shiny server takes in input and output lists. The model created in the server is reactive to the data entered by the user in the user interface. We use the notation of curly braces inside the parentheses for the reactive function. The brushed_data is shorthand for grabbing the data from brush1 input. We create a data frame with Girth and Volume variables from the trees dataset, and if there are fewer than two points, the function returns null. Otherwise, a linear model is fit where Volume is the y variable, Girth is the x variable, and the data is brushed_data. We don&#39;t need to put parentheses here because this is inside the reactive statement. If the model is fit, or output\)</span>slopeOut, which is a text label, then we use renderText to display it in the user interface. If it’s null, then it says “No Model Found”. Otherwise, it grabs the slope term. The same thing is done for the intercept term. We display plot1 using renderPlot, which has the reactive notation of having the curly braces inside the function argument. The plot shows Girth on the x-axis and Volume on the y-axis, with nice x and y labels and a title of “Tree Measurements”. If the model is not null, it adds a line that is only for the specific data points through the model that was fit just on the points described from the brush. Now, let’s run it and see how it looks.</p>
<p>We have run the application and observed that when no model is fit, the text output for slope and intercept correctly shows “No Model Found”. If a cluster of points is highlighted, the slope and intercept are calculated and displayed as a line. If no points are selected, the text output again shows “No Model Found”. A line is also displayed when all the data points are selected. This example shows the use of Shiny for creating interactive graphs. We encourage you to try to recreate this example and also create your own interactive graph using one of R’s built-in datasets. Shiny has many uses, including input and output of data frames, as well as embedding RGL and RS 3D graphics library in a Shiny webpage using WebGL. Although these advanced features may be more specialized, you now have enough knowledge to get started and incorporate Shiny into your toolkit.</p>

<p>In this lecture, we’ll be discussing Shiny Gadgets and We want to acknowledge Shaun Cross from the Data Science Lab for creating these slides. Previously, we covered a package called Manipulate, which was created by our studio for easy and simple interactive data analysis. However, it seems that development on Manipulate has stopped and we have a hunch why. Shiny provides a superior way of achieving the same goal, and with Shiny Gadgets, you can do everything that Manipulate did, but within the RStudio program. So, let’s delve into this topic.</p>
<p>The focus of this lecture is on Shiny Gadgets, which offer an easier and faster way to use Shiny’s interactivity in data analysis. Unlike Shiny, which is suitable for creating forward-facing apps for a wider audience, Shiny Gadgets are primarily designed for use by us or a small group of people working on data analysis. To display the app on a small screen within our RStudio program, we’ll use the mini UI package, which helps us create interfaces optimized for smaller screens. The core of a Shiny Gadget is a function that launches a small, single-page Shiny application in the RStudio viewer pane. Furthermore, since the Shiny Gadgets will be displayed in the RStudio viewer pane, the miniUI package is useful for creating interfaces that fit well on smaller screens. Next, we will create a basic Shiny Gadget and then simplify it as much as possible. Now, we will switch over to a code demonstration.</p>
<p>Let’s look into an example obtained from the code on the slides. To begin, we need to ensure that both Shiny and miniUI are loaded, and we can do this by installing the packages. If you have an older version of R, you may need to update it. The gadget is a function with a user interface and a server function, just like a Shiny app. The UI here uses miniPage, which is a layout from the miniUI library. We create a title bar element using the gadgetTitleBar command and call it “My First Gadget.” The server function takes input, output, and session arguments. For now, it checks the input for the “done” variable and uses the observeEvent function to stop the app when it is true. It is important to note that the syntax for Shiny Gadgets is a bit different from regular R programming, but the rules of reactivity still apply. Finally, we use the runGadget function to run the gadget with the UI and server functions. Once we run the function, we see “My First Gadget” displayed in the viewer pane, and clicking “done” takes us back to the RPrompt. This is a good first step to becoming familiar with Shiny Gadgets, and more complex concepts will come naturally as we progress. To move on to the next video, please copy and run this code from the selection notes.</p>
</div>
<div id="shiny-gadgets-1.2" class="section level3" number="1.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Shiny Gadgets 1.2</h3>
<p>The previous example we looked at was rather trivial, as it merely had a button to click and exit. It even had a built-in cancel button to stop the gadget and return to the R prompt. Now, we’ll demonstrate how to add arguments to your Shiny Gadget. We’ll keep it simple and show basic manipulations so that you can understand the coding process and apply it to your own application.
Let’s examine the code in detail. The code is divided into two parts due to space limitations. The first part contains the UI, which is again a mini page. The second part contains the server. Remember, we need to load two libraries. Our gadget’s title will be “Multiply Two Numbers.” The content panel will be a mini content panel, which will be the main body of the pane. The user interface will have a selector input, which will be a dropdown box with two variables labeled “num1” and “num2.” We will use these names to reference them later. The labels and choices come from the two arguments in the function.
Moving on to the server part, we will have input, output, and session. We will use the input$done variable in the observe event to let Shiny know when it’s done to quit. We must use curly braces in the correct place to avoid the most common mistake when coding Shiny applications. We will name num1 and num2 as the input values to make them easier to work with. We will then multiply them together, and the stopApp function will tell Shiny to stop and display the result of num1 multiplied by num2. Remember to include the runGadget function, which specifies the UI and server. Although you could technically name UI and server something else, it is not conventionally done.
Let’s now look at the code demonstration and see how it works. Let’s review the function that we copied from the R markdown document and make sure the necessary libraries are loaded. Now let’s execute the function. Although we have already gone over the components, let’s see what happens when we run it. As expected, nothing happens because we have just defined the function. Let’s give the numbers 1 to 10 as choices for both selector inputs. Suppose we want to check our multiplication tables, so let’s choose 4 and 7 and hopefully get the result of 28. Once we click “Done”, we will return to the R pane where we should see the result of 28. This is just the first step towards creating something useful. We have been able to select from choices and perform numerical manipulations. we hope you can see where Shiny gadgets can be useful for you. In the next step, we will create an interactive graphic.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span> Shiny Gadgets 1.3</h3>
<p>One of the most valuable features of Shiny gadgets is the ability to create interactive plots. As many of you are already familiar with Shiny syntax from our previous modules, we won’t spend too much time revisiting that in the context of Shiny gadgets. Instead, we’ll present one example, and with your understanding of Shiny and a little extra syntax for Shiny gadgets, you’ll be able to construct and customize your own gadgets to meet your needs. In this example, our goal is to create an interactive plot of the trees dataset, specifically plotting the girth by volume. We want to have a crosshair that will allow us to select a rectangle on the plot, and then have our function output a data frame of the trees within that rectangle. We will now attempt to achieve this. As always, we need to load the Shiny and mini libraries. Our Shiny gadget is a function that requires a user interface (UI). For the UI, we will use the miniPage function from the mini package. We will have a gadgetTitleBar with the message “Select points by dragging your mouse” and a miniContentPanel containing a plot with the name “plot”. We want the height to be 100% and we will name the crosshairs brush.
Moving on to the server function, we will use the names “plot” and “brush” that we defined earlier. The output named “plot” will be created using the renderPlot function. We will plot the “girth” versus “volume” data from the “trees” dataset and label the plot with the title “trees” and axis labels “girth” and “volume”. Next, we use observeEvent to collect the brush points and stop the app after a rectangle is selected from the “trees” dataset. The input will be “$brush”, which refers to the named input we defined earlier. The variables “xvar” and “yvar” need to be named correctly and matched to the corresponding names in the “trees” dataset. Finally, we call the runGadget function. By running this code, we can create a useful tool for selecting data points from a plot. We need to load the Shiny and mini UI libraries, define our Shiny gadget function named “pick trees”, and use the UI and server functions that we have defined.
Now we can execute the code. The function doesn’t require any arguments. It starts the server and generates the plot. The plot allows me to select a collection of points by dragging the crosshair around. After I’ve made my selection, We can move the box around if we need to. Once we am satisfied with my selection, we click the “Done” button, and it returns the data points from my selection. To save the selected data points, we can assign them to a variable like treesIPicked, and then we can retrieve them later by calling the variable. This feature can be useful if you need to select specific data points, for example, to identify outliers in a data analysis. Note that the original data frame’s row numbers are retained, enabling you to refer back to the data frame itself. To clarify about naming, suppose we named the plot “plot1” instead of “plot”. If we rerun the code, the plot will not show up because we named it “plot” and not “plot1”. Similarly, if we name the brush “brush1” instead of “brush”, it will not output anything because it is looking for “input brush”, not “input brush1”, and “input brush” has no input.
We hope these tools provide you with a good foundation to build your own Shiny gadgets. Learning how to build them is definitely worth it, especially for creating interactive graphics which can be extremely helpful. R has not historically excelled in this area, so having the add-on provided by RStudio is a valuable resource to have in your workflow. For this reason alone, it’s worth taking the time to learn how to build and incorporate shiny gadgets into your work.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> GoogleVis 1.1</h3>
<p>GoogleVis is a highly impressive R package that links R with Google’s visualization API. It’s an extensively developed package that comes with great documentation, making it a must-consider in this course. The package enables you to produce interactive graphics in a pretty impressive way, capitalizing on Google’s existing interactive graphics. In this section, we will present a few examples of what you can achieve with googleVis. From there, you can take it further, leveraging the package’s capabilities. With googleVis, you can easily produce graphics such as maps, plots, and motion charts that would be challenging to build on your own. Linking R with googleVis simplifies the process, particularly if you have some familiarity with R. Let’s dive into a motion chart to kick things off. Let’s start by creating our first plot using googleVis package. It’s important to note that the syntax used in these R Markdown notes is mainly focused on embedding the chart in the slides. However, we will show you how to retrieve the chart as raw HTML. First, we need to load the googleVis package using the library function. Then, we can create our gVis motion chart using the data frame “fruits”. Alright, here you go. You can see how the data is set up in the <code>fruits</code> data frame - it has different types of fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, along with their sales, expenses, profit, and date. This kind of data frame is suitable for creating a motion chart. So let’s go ahead and run it. We have assigned the output of <code>gvisMotionChart</code> to a variable <code>M</code>. So, to view the plot, simply type <code>plot(M)</code> and a browser window will open showing the motion chart. It’s similar to the Hans Rosling motion chart where you can click the play button to see the changes over time. You can also adjust the scales of the columns in your data frame, such as including time and profit.
Alright, so let’s take a look at the fruit profits over time. You can observe how the profits of different fruits are fluctuating over time. You can choose to show one or multiple fruits or highlight specific ones. It’s a pretty clever chart, actually. It includes bar charts and line charts all in the same graph, and it’s all created using JavaScript organized by the gVis R package. If you want to view the HTML page, simply type print(M), which will give you the relevant HTML, including the JavaScript data and header. The beginning of the HTML page may be cut off in the display. So, you can observe the HTML page’s end, including the end of the body and so on. The object M itself, when printed, will display the page. Alternatively, you can use “print(M, file =”test.html”)” to generate the page. Usually, you will create the chart using gVis, use plot to debug and refine it, and then extract the relevant HTML and JavaScript code to embed in a different web page. To learn how to embed the chart in slides or R markdown, please refer to the R markdown document for this lecture. Your homework is to replicate this motion chart, ensure that you can visualize it in a browser window, and experiment with googleVis by installing it and trying it out. In the next part, we’ll explore some other chart types.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.2</span> GoogleVis 1.2</h3>
<p>The googleVis package is a powerful tool that provides access to various visualization tools offered by Google. Aside from motion charts, which we have already discussed, it also offers interactive maps, tables, line charts, bar charts, and even speedometers based on specific metrics. If you want to explore these features, simply refer to the googleVis documentation. It is thoroughly documented and provides both a vignette and packaged documentation. Interactive visualization is a powerful feature offered by googleVis, as it provides access to a variety of visualization tools developed by Google. Motion charts, interactive maps, tables, line charts, bar charts, and even speedometers are some of the tools available. The package documentation and vignette are both well-written and offer a comprehensive list of available options for customization. Mapping is made easy with Google’s pre-built tools, and creating JavaScript maps with pop-ups for specified countries can be embedded into various forms of media. The R Markdown presentation provides an example of how interactivity can be utilized with zoom-in features and options specifications. To specify options, a list must be created with correctly named values using JSON syntax. This syntax may take a bit of getting used to, but it should not pose a problem with some practice. Additionally, gvisMerge allows for multiple plots to be merged together, providing further customization options. After completing the steps, on the left-hand side of the plot, you can see the plot, a table, and a chart combined together. In this code example, you can view the code by using the print function, which we have already discussed. Additionally, you can embed the results in a markdown document just like we have done in this document. Two important things to keep in mind are having the latest versions of everything, including R, Slidify, and data, and including “results = ‘asis’” in the chunk options. Without this option, the process may not work properly. Although the process can be finicky and may require tweaking and reinstallation, it usually works in the end. It is important to clear the knitr cache as well. Now, let’s move on to generate some interesting graphs by going through the code. So, as a first step, let’s generate this chart. Before we dive into it, let’s take a look at the data frame that we’ll be displaying. It contains country names, a value for the pop-up, and whether they are online or not. For now, we’ll just use the country and profit variables. Moving on to our code, we see the function <code>gvisGeoChart</code> with the data frame <code>Exports</code> and the <code>locationvar</code> set to “Country”, which is the variable name for the country names. The <code>colorvar</code> is set to “profit”. Additionally, we have some formatting options set in the <code>options</code> argument. Let’s run this code and then plot the result so we can take a look at it. Alright, so now we have the interactive map generated and it’s pretty cool for such a little effort. When we run the code, it brings up a webpage with the interactive map. Moving on, let’s see how we can specify a region using the gvisGeoChart function. We can do this by setting the “region” option to a certain value, such as 150. When we run the code for this and plot G2, it zooms in on the specified region, which in this case is Western Europe. Next, let’s take a look at some of the options we can set for a line chart. First, we’ll create a simple data frame with countries and their corresponding values. Then, we’ll use the gVis chart function to create a line chart and name it “Line” with a capital L. Finally, we’ll plot “Line” to bring up the simple plot that says “Hello world” and displays the chart. Let’s examine the way we’re setting the options and relate them back to the plot. While the JavaScript notation might be irritating if you’re not accustomed to it, you’re basically passing the options exactly as Google Charts expects you to pass them. There’s no intermediary translation involved. It’s useful to know because you may eventually want to produce a Google Chart using Google Docs or something similar and set the options in the same way they’re set here. Lastly, we want to generate multiple plots together. We’ve generated our geo chart as before and then created a table. This is simply an illustration of how to create a table by taking our data as is. Let’s take a look at the motion chart we created earlier. We will now combine the GeoChart and gvisTable in a single plot using the merge function. Setting the horizontal parameter to FALSE means that they will be stacked vertically. We will then merge this new plot with the motion chart by setting the horizontal parameter to TRUE. If we print the result using plot DTM, we can see the final product. As you can see, it looks great! The plot is displayed at the top, followed by the data frame printout and an interactive table. You can customize the background color and other features by adjusting the options. This plot is incredibly useful and requires very little code, thanks to Google’s plotting library doing all the heavy lifting in the background. Give it a try and create some Google Charts of your own. You will be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is. For homework, try creating a few more of these.</p>

<p>In this lecture, we will be discussing Plotly - a handy web application and R library. Although we had previously recorded a video on it during its early development for R, there have been a lot of developements since then. Plotly is a great tool for creating interactive web graphics in R, and it has the added benefit of integrating with multiple languages. Essentially, Plotly is a web application that enables the creation and sharing of visualizations. Plotly is a versatile web application and library for R that allows users to create interactive web graphics. It can work with several programming languages including MATLAB, Python, and JavaScript. In addition to its integration with different languages, Plotly offers a web interface for users who prefer to upload csv files and create plots with point-and-click interactions. Plotly is particularly easy to use with R and RStudio. To install Plotly, users can simply type “install.packages(”plotly”)“. To use it, they can load it with”library” or “require (”plotly”)“. Plotly plots can be shared through its web interface, which offers free and paid options for private displays and user authentication. Alternatively, users can create HTML graphics that can be shared on their own websites with the Plotly R package. The Plotly web interface offers tools for interactively changing axis labels, a feature that is not available in R. In this lecture, code demonstrations will be used to showcase different types of Plotly plots. It is worth noting that Plotly graphics can be embedded in R Markdown documents, including Slidify, R Studio Presenter, and Slidy documents.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span> Plotly 1.2</h3>
<p>Here in the R markdown document associated with the Plotly lecture, I will be using the library(plotly) function, assuming that I have already installed it. The plot_ly() command is straightforward: plot_ly(mtcars, x = “weight”, y = “miles per gallon”, mode = “markers”). The mtcars dataset is stored as a dataframe and serves as the data source for this command. The x-axis represents weight, while the y-axis represents miles per gallon, and the mode is set to markers, creating a scatter plot. This code can be replicated for any dataframe to generate a scatter plot. The resulting scatter plot is interactive and can be viewed in the RStudio viewer pane. As you move your cursor over the points, their corresponding x and y values are displayed. In addition, there are various controls at the top of the viewer pane that enable you to download the plot as a PNG, adjust the scale, reset the axes, and modify the hover-over behavior, among other things. The Publish button allows you to publish the plot to RPubs with a single click, generating a web graphic. However, we’ll demonstrate other methods for publishing the plot shortly. Another easy way to publish the plot is to click on Export and choose to Save as Web Page. This creates a Web page with the plot and a file with the specified name, which can be referenced and embedded into other projects. Plotly is incredibly user-friendly and straightforward. Your first assignment is to create a simple scatter plot with a different dataset, save it as a webpage, and create graphics in PNG and PDF formats. You can also try publishing the plot to RPubs.</p>

<div id="plotly-1.3" class="section level3" number="1.7.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.3</span> Plotly 1.3</h3>
<p>Let’s explore some options for scatter plotting in plot_ly, as scatter plots are a common type of visualization. One option is to change the color of the points. For example, we can use the “cyl” variable from the mtcars dataset as a factor variable for coloring the points. To do this, we convert the “cyl” variable to a factor using the function as.factor(cyl). Then, we plot the scatter plot using plot_ly(mtcars, x = weight, y = mpg, color = as.factor(cyl), mode = “markers”). This will create a scatter plot where the points are colored based on the number of cylinders in the car, which is effectively a categorical variable. By default, the legend will display the three values of “cyl”: 4, 6, and 8.</p>
<p>Another option is to use a continuous variable for coloring the points. For example, we can use the “disp” variable from the mtcars dataset, which is a continuous variable. To do this, we plot the scatter plot using plot_ly(mtcars, x = weight, y = mpg, color = disp, mode = “markers”). plot_ly will recognize that “disp” is a continuous variable and use a continuous color gradient to display the points. The key to the gradient will be displayed on the side of the plot.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the option of changing the point size in scatter plots using plot_ly. Currently, the points in the scatter plot appear small, almost invisible when outputted to an HTML file. We can change the size of the points using a continuous variable, in this case, horsepower. Each point will have a different size based on its horsepower. Color is already being used to represent the cylinder. By changing the size of the points, we can show four dimensions in the same plot: miles per gallon, weight, cylinders, and horsepower. However, since we’re limited to a 2D scatter plot, color and size are the only two dimensions we can display along with the x and y coordinates. Let’s look into a 3D scatterplot. We will run the code and display the plot, and then we will explain what it’s doing. This is another way to add a dimension to a scatter plot. The plot is created using web GL, which is a web-based version of the open GL graphics library. It allows you to embed interactive 3D graphics in webpages. So when you output it as a webpage, it will be interactive just like this. We have three variables in this example: temperature, pressure, and dtime. To create the dataset, we generated 100 random normal values for temperature and pressure, and dtime is just the numbers 1 to 100. We use the same “plot_ly” command as before, specifying the x, y, and z variables and setting type to “scatter3d” and mode to “markers”. To add a color gradient to the plot, we use the “color = temp” parameter, which displays a key to the gradient on the side of the plot. This creates a nice interactive 3D scatter plot. For homework, I would like you to create a variety of 2D scatter plots using different plotting attributes, such as color and point shape, to visualize other dimensions. You can also create a 3D scatter plot and output it as a web page to become familiar with working with these types of plots. You may consider publishing your scatter plots on platforms like rpubs to have a public hosting. Give it a try and explore the possibilities. Next, we will discuss some even more exciting applications of plot_ly.</p>

<div id="plotly-1.4" class="section level3" number="1.7.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.4</span> Plotly 1.4</h3>
<p>Let’s discuss a different type of chart, the line graph. To illustrate this, let’s use the “airmiles” dataset, which is a time series with values corresponding to each year. We can confirm this by typing “data(”airmiles”)” and then “time(airmiles)” to see the associated times.</p>
<p>To create the line graph using Plotly, we simply use the “plot_ly” command with the “x” argument set to the time variable and the “y” argument set to “airmiles”. Since these variables are in our environment, we don’t need to specify a data frame. Once we plot the data, we get a time series chart with the added feature of showing the corresponding x and y values when the mouse hovers over the plot. This type of chart is often used to display market indices, such as the S&amp;P 500. Let’s talk about creating a line graph using time series data. We can use the “airmiles” dataset as an example. It is a time series with values corresponding to each year. To create the line graph, we can use the “plot_ly” command, with “x” as the time variable and “y” as the airmiles variable. The resulting plot will display the values over time, and when we hover over the plot, it will display the corresponding x and y values. A similar plot is often used to display market indices like the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Now, let’s create a multi-line graph using stock market data. We’ll need to use the “tidyr” and “dplyr” libraries for data manipulation. The “EuStockMarkets” dataset contains market indices from Germany, Switzerland, France, and Britain. To create the plot, we first convert the dataset into a data frame using the “as.data.frame” command. Then, we use the “gather” command to convert the data into a format suitable for plotting. The resulting data frame can be used with the “plot_ly” command to create a multi-line graph. Note that the original data EuStockMarkets is not a data frame, as shown by the output of is.data.frame(EuStockMarkets). However, after converting it to a data frame using the command as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets) and then applying the gather command, we have transformed the data from a short format to a long format. In the long format, there is a variable called index which corresponds to the column name of the data points in the original data. Although this format may not be as convenient for display purposes, it is necessary for plot_ly to display multiple lines, as it requires a single data frame with a factor variable that demarcates the different lines. Let’s take a look at how we can create a multi-line graph using stock market data. To begin with, we need to convert the data into a data frame. EuStockMarkets is not a data frame, as shown by the is.data.frame() function. Therefore, we first need to convert it into a data frame using the command “stocks &lt;- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets)”. We then use the gather() function from tidyr to convert the data from a short format to a long format, where each index type is now in a single column called “index”. The final step is to create the time variable using the command “stocks$time &lt;- as.Date(rownames(stocks))”. Once the data is formatted correctly, we can create the plot using plot_ly, where x is time, y is price, and color is the index type. The resulting plot will display the different index types in different colors and allow for interactive hovering over specific points to see the index value at that time. It’s worth noting that using tidyr and dplyr for data manipulation is essential and highly recommended. Give it a try using this data or some other stock market data, and see if you can create your own multi-line stock market graph to display on a webpage.</p>

<div id="plotly-1.5" class="section level3" number="1.7.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.5</span> Plotly 1.5</h3>
<p>The following examples are straightforward, so I won’t provide any code demonstrations. Instead, I’ll show you the resulting output. To create a histogram in plot_ly, you only need to specify the x variable and set the type to “histogram.” The output will show the height of the bars as you move the mouse along. Additionally, you can customize the colors, create side-by-side histograms, and perform a variety of other actions in plot_ly.</p>
<p>For a boxplot, you’ll need to provide the plot_ly data frame (in this example, it’s the iris dataset), set the y variable to petal length, specify the color as species, and set the type to “box.” This will generate separate boxplots for each species. When you hover over the boxplot, it’ll display values such as the 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and median. The whiskers extend out to 1.5 times the distance between these two values, as per Tukey’s idea, which refers back to the normal distribution and the 1.5 times the inter-quartile range. If there’s an outlier, plot_ly will display a little point to indicate it.</p>
<p>The following examples are relatively straightforward, so I won’t provide code demonstrations. For a histogram, simply specify type=“histogram” and the x variable. Here is an example:</p>
<p>[Output shown]</p>
<p>You can change the colors, display side-by-side histograms, and perform other modifications using plot_ly. The process is intuitive. For a box plot, use the plot_ly data frame, specify y=petal length, color=species, and type=“box”. The result will be separate box plots for each species. Here is an example:</p>
<p>[Output shown]</p>
<p>Hovering over the box provides information about the box plot, such as the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers that extend 1.5 times the distance between these values. A heat map is essentially a graphical representation of an image. To create one using plot_ly, generate a matrix with random normal values and specify z=matrix, type=“heatmap”. The result will be an interactive heat map with a color key on the right-hand side. As you move your mouse around, plot_ly will display x and y values and the corresponding intensity values. We can create a similar dataset as before, but with different random normal values. Next, instead of plotting the intensity values as colors, we can plot them in a third dimension as a surface. To do this, we set the type as “surface” and specify the z values as the intensity values. The row and column values are assigned integers for the x and y values. The resulting plot is a 3D surface. It’s worth noting that when plotting a 3D surface, there is some smoothing involved, so it’s important to understand what this smoothing is doing if you plan on using this for real.</p>

<div id="plotly-1.6" class="section level3" number="1.7.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.6</span> Plotly 1.6</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s create a map with some interactive hover-over effects. The code in this example is a bit long, so I won’t go over every detail. First, let’s create the dataset and then display it.
Here we show you the first few rows of this dataset. As you can see, there are 50 rows, each representing a state. For example, the first row is for Alabama and includes its population in millions and some hover-over text. The hover-over text includes the state abbreviation, “AL”, a line break, and the population in 1975, which was 3,615,000. We can also add red borders as an option, although it’s not necessary. Additionally, the map options will be a list and we will set the scope to the USA. You can experiment with different options to see what works best. To dramatically alter this map for a different region or country, you may have to improvise a bit, but many of the options are self-explanatory. The “showlakes = TRUE” option simply means that lakes will be displayed, and in this case, the lake color was set to white to avoid blending in with the blue population color.
To break down the code we start by selecting the first couple of rows of the dataset and displaying them to get an idea of what it looks like. It contains the population of each state in millions and some hover-over text which includes the state abbreviation and population in 1975.
Next, we set some map options such as showing the lakes, setting the lake color to white, and selecting the USA as the scope.
Then we use the <code>plot_ly</code> command to create the choropleth map. We use the <code>state_pop</code> dataframe, set the population column as the color variable, and use the state column for locations. We set the type to choropleth and location mode to USA-states. We use a blue color palette and specify that we want to draw markers on the borders.
Finally, we pass the output of <code>plot_ly</code> to <code>layout</code>, which sets a title and includes the map options we previously set.</p>
<p>We can go ahead and run this code now.
In our case, it was a bit complicated and the map wouldn’t display in the viewer. So, we saved it as a web page and overwrote the template web page that we’ve been using for this example. Now, when if we hover over a state, we can see its population. For example, when we can hover over Alabama and see its population of 3,615,000 in 1975.</p>
<p>If you want to create your own map, start by using this data frame, which has more columns than just population, and try creating different maps with various options. As you experiment with different options, you’ll get a better understanding of how they work. To begin with, you can replicate the map we just created and then attempt to create another map using different variables, where the color represents something else. This can be a helpful technique to create interactive maps.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of ggplot, then you might like this code from the Plotly website. I’m using the diamond dataset to create a ggplot of carat vs. price. What’s cool is that Plotly has a function called ggplotly that allows you to easily convert a ggplot into an interactive HTML graphic.

However, if we type plotly_POST GG, it will post it directly to the Plotly website. You can then use their web-based graphical user interface to edit the graph by clicking on the edit option. Plotly has many tutorials and videos to help you understand how to use it. Before using Plotly, you must set two environment variables - plotly username and plotly API key. You can find your API key by going to the settings in Plotly and copying and pasting it from there. If you set these two environment variables in your .Rprofile, you won’t be prompted for your credentials every time you start R, making the process seamless.</p>
